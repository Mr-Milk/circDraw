## Cleaning tools for reset database/empty tables.

### Migrations
Every time you change your models from tools.models.py, you have to remigrate the whole database and run django command. To expendite the development, you can simply pass 'migration' from the command line.


```python
# From process_watchdog fold, run:
python3 resetdb.py admin_login.json migration
```
It will drop tables that can be django creates and delete the django migration infomation from django_migrations table in database.
Here is how it's going to react:

### Clean database
Old files and data previously stored in database shouldn't obstacle the circle of development and therefore you can run the following code to remove them.


```python
# From process_watchdog fold, run:
python3 resetdb.py admin_login.json clean
```

This will clean data in tables that can be managed by django, and also remove the result file that was generated by processing previous data.
